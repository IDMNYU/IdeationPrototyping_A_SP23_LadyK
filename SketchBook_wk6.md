###### Sketch: Human figures & Hands + Interactions

- Sketchbook warm up: draw a set of a Stick Figure, Starfish person, and Bobular figure. These are a crew. Draw the crew in 3 different configurations and positions. Have the first one be standing. Then perhaps the next crew configuration: one bends to the side to their toes, another leans back, another leans forward (but is viewed from the side). Draw your own crew configuration for the last one.

- Sketchbook warm up: Draw your own set of 5 custom figures. Each being different. Play with different geographic shapes for the body, arms, and leds

- Take one of your crew (or two) and show them in motion. Use arrows and draw a series of "frames" showing the action, gesture and direction. Watch your curves of your shape.

- Fill half a page showing this character in a variety of positions and movements (20+ positions). These are meant to be kinda quick and easy, once you get your bearing.

- Using a mirror, sketch your wire frame in a variety of poses. Watch your angles, position. These are meant to be kinda quick and easy, once you get your bearing. Draw 10 poses.

- Draw a simplified hand in 5 different positions

- Draw your hand twice; Once in a study of shape and proportion in a position. The other a bit more blocking thinking/focusing on the bone and muscle structure below to guide you;

- Draw a sketch of your hand interacting with something. Convey motion/history, direction and grip. Going further: do a second one (things get better on a second go).
