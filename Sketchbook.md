# Sketchbook

Drawing is a skill that will be developed and strengthen as it is a powerful tool in your arsenal to explore and to communicate ideas. Over the course of the semester we will begin with simple drawing exercises to get comfortable with drawing and to increase hand-eye coordination. Exercises will ramp up to then be used to develop ideas and concepts related to other areas of this course.

## Tools Required

* a good pencil HB or 2B (at minimum), or range of pencils; Suggestions: [Dick Blick](https://www.dickblick.com/items/faber-castell-goldfaber-sketching-pencil-hb/), [Artist Craftsman](https://artistcraftsman.com/staedtler-mars-lumograph-drawing-pencils-set-of-6/) or similar elsewhere; If you want to go all out and widen your vocabulary, you can buy a small set (3-8 pencils of varying lead weights)

* a fine tipped ink pen. Suggestions: [Dick Blick](https://www.dickblick.com/items/staedtler-pigment-liner-black-03-mm/), [Artist Craftsman](https://artistcraftsman.com/sakura-pigma-micron-pens-03-black-set-of-3/) or similar elsewhere

* A BOUND Sketch book that is no smaller than 8.5 x 5" (Ideally it's larger) and no less than 75 pages; ( [The heavier the paper](https://www.schoolspecialty.com/wcsstore/SSICatalogAssetStore/ideas-resources/V2182597.pdf), the wetter ink it can hold); Popular favorites: [Moleskin @ DickBlick](https://www.dickblick.com/products/moleskine-art-collection-sketchbooks/), [another @ DickBlick](https://www.dickblick.com/products/moleskine-art-collection-sketch-pad/), [Strathmore option @ ArtistCraftsman](https://artistcraftsman.com/strathmore-400-series-sketch-art-journals/), Canson is another good name/option

In addition to the drawing exercises and development of assignments in projects in this class, use this sketchbook to collect ideas, questions, loves, hates, inspiration, drawings, photos, visual and textual scraps, ephemera, fragments, imprints, rubbings, stains, odds and ends. Choose a notebook that is small enough that you will most likely keep with you and use. This book must be new this semester. Make it your own with stickers, markers, paint, collage, whatever. Carry this notebook with you at all times (as well as something to write tools) and use it often.

You will document your analog notebook on a weekly basis through photos or videos posted to your process site. 


## Additional Prompts 

For many students, this sketchbook maybe a first one for you. You may be wondering of how to use this. If you are still struggling remember the following:

* This sketchbook is not only for this class. Don't think of it as a notebook for this course work (ie, notes from class, sketches for coursework, and/or solely coursework). Instead, think of it as a collection tool for things you are drawn to. Ideas. Think of it as an external brain. Think of it as a sandbox to experiment. 

* For additional ideas on different ways to use your sketchbook and for different exercises, check out the <a href = "sketch_journalPrompts.md"> prompts and experiment. </a> Have fun and cut loose!
