###### Sketch: Hands + Interactions

- Using a mirror, sketch your wire frame in a variety of poses. Watch your angles, position. These are meant to be kinda quick and easy, once you get your bearing. Draw 10 poses.

- Draw a simplified hand in 5 different positions

- Draw your hand twice; Once in a study of shape and proportion in a position. The other a bit more blocking thinking/focusing on the bone and muscle structure below to guide you;

- Draw a sketch of your hand interacting with something. Convey motion/history, direction and grip. Going further: do a second one (things get better on a second go).
