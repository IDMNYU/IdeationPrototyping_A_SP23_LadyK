### DM-UY 1143 A Ideation and Prototyping
##### Spring 2023 • Katherine Bennett • Mon/Wed 2:00PM-3:50PM • 370 Jay Room 311


## Object/Future Artifact

You will brainstorm, research, sketch, map, design, and build _physical_ prototypes of an object(s) from your imagined future.

Re-read [Module 9](https://teaching.polishedsolid.com/ip/mod9/content/index.html#/?_k=ht4wi1), paying close attention to the different ways to prototype. Prototyping is a powerful tool to explore and to develop ideas. [Review Professor McDermott slides on prototyping.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oJ8tl6b4DAulHHuujexnBFFJwNhoD3eJio_lyoJMSxE/edit?usp=sharing) 

As this artifact is from your future, you may not be able to develop it into full actuality. The point is to explore and to develop your idea. As such, prototyping is a powerful technique to utilize.

You will develop several iterations of your object over the course of this project. Each iteration should show evidence of the development strides of your idea.

This Future Artifact can be central to your narrative, _but it does not have to be_. It should not be some random element to your future. It should be considered, have meaning, and some significance to your future.

While 1 iteration maybe a drawing or a high fidelity rendering, other iterations must be physical. They can be low-fidelity (especially in the beginning). 

As you advance your idea and to make the most of the resources that NYU offers, I encourage you to use the [NYU Makerspace](http://makerspace.engineering.nyu.edu/) as it is an incredible resource for you as an NYU student. (This is why it was mentioned to several times earlier in the semester to investigate the [orientations](http://makerspace.engineering.nyu.edu/training-and-reservations/) there). They have laser cutters, 3-D printers, sewing machines, milling machines... you name it! What a resource! [Thingiverse,](https://www.thingiverse.com/) is another great resource to possibly use in conjunction. See more about [them](https://www.thingiverse.com/about) as well as [tips](https://www.thingiverse.com/jumpstart) in getting started.
