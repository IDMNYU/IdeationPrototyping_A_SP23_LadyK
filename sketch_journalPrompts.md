### The Sketchbook/Journal is your respoitory to COLLECT thoughts, ideas, pieces, things of interest, things that inspire you.... If you aren't collecting anything, you are missing on arsenal to look back and to connect ideas. [Watch this short video](https://vimeo.com/223635321).



#### Use the prompts below as mechanisms to use within your sketchbook/journals, in order to develop your practice. Check back regularly as this document will be updated!



## Étrécissement (reductive drawing with paper)
##### Materials
* Magazines, printed images
* scissors, craft/utility knife
* glue stick, tape, etc

This is a great technique, especially for those that feel that drawing is not their strong suit.

Using an existing image, cut into it to reveal the image or blank page underneath it.

Cut into the image and notice what is underneath. Move or shift the top layer to find a pleasing shape or combination.

## Collage (additive drawing)
##### Materials
* Magazines, printed images
* scissors, craft/utility knife
* glue stick, tape, etc

Using this technique, build your image out element of other images. This first thing that may come to mind is to subtract elements from one image and then to add them too a collection in another image. (Ie, cut out the coffee pot from one image and put it in the image with the collection from other images). Take this further. Use your pencil or scissors to create shapes to cut out. Then use these shapes to _build_ a final image.

Work in layers!

## Entopic Graphomania 
##### Materials
* colored pencils
* pens, brushes
* junk mail, carry out menus, etc; page from a book

A Surrealist game, Entopic Graphomania was used to spot the imperfections in a piece of paper that was common in that day. Create dots at the imperfections. Then create a line, curve, zigzag or wavey line to the next imperfection.

Think of this as more of a system that generates drawing. Think of it as an automated drawing, a system to abid by. Let yourself go and follow the system.

Use punctuation, a particular letter, vowel, etc. Use different words to have different connection lines (dot versus solid). 


##### Check out this [demo](https://markmakingexercises.com/entopic-graphomania/). Google image searching of the term yields many visual examples







## Make a Pattern
##### Materials
* black marker
* scissors
* tape
* Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop (available via NYU On The Hub)
* scanner or smart phone image/picture app

1. Start with a clean piece of paper, choose your black marker and draw an image in the middle of the page. Don't let your graphics touch the edge of the page. Make the image as simple or as complex as you want.

2. Fold the paper in half. Unfold it, flatten it and cut it along the edges.

3. On a flat surface, swap the sides and tape them together, ensuring the edges of the paper line up.

4. Now fold them in the other direction (ie, if in #2, you folded vertical, now fold horizontal or vice versa). Unfold it, flatten it and cut on the fold.

5. On a flat surface, swap the two sides. Line the edges up and tape.

6. You can add to your drawing manually, if you'd like.

7. Now you have a repeatable tile.!

8. Scan it into photoshop or illustrator. Use this graphic as a tile to build a larger pattern.

## Make Some Marks
##### Materials
* black marker (different instruments will create different marks. experiment)
* sketch book

Let yourself go and just draw lines, dots, circles or squares. Create a little system with these ingredients, as well as something to alert you to change. Perhaps it's a short timer set for random intervals of 2-3 minutes. Perhaps it's stops on the MTA. Draw your system until the next stopping point. Then turn the paper and begin again at another point on the page. Perhaps right next to it, perhaps at a different place on the page. 

Work quickly. Don't be critical of what you are generating while you are in the process.

## Collection of Thoughts
##### Materials
* black marker (different instruments will create different marks. experiment)
* sketch book

At the end of your day, open up your sketchbook and write down all the major thoughts that are running through your head. Perhaps it's nagging thoughts. Perhaps it's celebratory moments. Or small discoveries.

Jot down words and headings to describe your day. What are you taking away from this day? What would you like to build up tomorrow?

Use this as collection pool.
