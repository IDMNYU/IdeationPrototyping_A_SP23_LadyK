###### Sketch: Orthographic & Curved Planes



 - Sketchbook: Fill a page exploring curvilinear lines and forms. Draw a series of fair curves towards your body. Draw another series of fair curves away from your body. Notice the difference in control, regarding your body position.

 - Sketchbook: Practice drawing curved planes. Fill a page drawing ribbons. Think of the fair curves, using minimal distortion, and only curved on two edges. Play with line weight and the contour lines. Consider drawing light interior lines to show the contour of the distorted surface.

 - Sketchbook: Follow the instructions on page 76-79 for drawing a rectilinear plane in flat orthographic view, one-point perspective (using one vanishing point), and two-point perspective (using two vanishing points)

 - Now, combine the curved planes with the rectilinear planes. Try a simple curve, a compound curve, and a combination of simple and compan curves over a rectilinear plane (see page 78)! <--- after doing the above, try this!

 - Going Further: Try some complex wrinkled, faceted, or wavy surfaces by projecting vertical lines from the intersection of the grid lines on the flat plane. (see page 79)
