###### Sketch: Orthographic & Curved Planes


 - Sketchbook: (Warm up) Fill a page, exploring the orthographic views of an object, in front and side views. Then simplify that form into basic geometric shapes using two point perspective and divide it along parting lines. Re-draw it with details and features; Then again showing how it might work, move or operate (see pg 70).

 - Sketchbook: Fill 2 pages exploring curvilinear lines and forms. Draw a series of fair curves towards your body. Draw another series of fair curves away from your body. Notice the difference in control, regarding your body position.

 - Sketchbook: Practice drawing curved planes. Fill a page or 2 drawing ribbons. Think of the fair curves, using minimal distortion, and only curved on two edges. Play with line weight and the contour lines. Consider drawing light interior lines to show the contour of the distorted surface.

 - Sketchbook: Follow the instructions on page 76-79 for drawing a rectilinear plane in flat orthographic view, one-point perspective (using one vanishing point), and two-point perspective (using two vanishing points)

 - Now, combine the curved planes with the rectilinear planes. Try a simple curve, a compound curve, and a combination of simple and compan curves over a rectilinear plane (see page 78). 

 - Try some complex wrinkled, faceted, or wavy surfaces by projecting vertical lines from the intersection of the grid lines on the flat plane. (see page 79)
