###### Read 

* Drawing Ideas ch 1 (skip the part about making ones sketch book unless you are inclined to do so.)

* Read Ch 2 - p.63.

###### Sketch:

 - Sketchbook: Pay attention to your body position (as specified in the readings), and sketch a half page of lines. Focus on straight lines, of different lengths. Experiment with different line weights.

 - Sketchbook: a page or 2 of multiple rectiliner forms. Create forms of different sizes, different orientations and different presepectives.

 - Sketchbook: Draw another page or 2 of multiple rectilinear forms. Draw four distinct lines for each. 

 - Sketchbook: Then take a page from the previous sketch: Experiment with different hatching methods to those forms. See the references in the text.

 - Sketchbook: On a new page to two, explore a composition using lines, squares and rectangles. One could think of this as a page layout with callout boxes, thumbnails, frames. Make a few different iterations of this composition, experimenting with positioning, composition, overlap and proximity. Watch your proportions!
