###### Sketch:

- Sketchbook: Draw a page of 3-D forms playing with different types: oblique, Isometric, and two-point perspectives; with cubes, cylinders, trapezoids and cones.

- Sketchbook: Complete the exercise on p.64-65 2-3+ times to get comfortable with it. Use your straight edge.

- Sketchbook: Fill two to three pages +, by exploring the cube from elevations in space such as lower than the horizon line, different angles in relation to the horizon line, and different cubic forms.

- Sketchbook: Find a furniture catalog or architectural design magazine, and trace the 3D structures. (a sharpie on parchment or wax paper can help). Trace multiple structures. Scotch tape or glue stick these into your sketchbook. 

- Sketchbook: Sketch a page freehand in two-point perspective, sketching planes at a variety of angles (See text).

- Sketchbook: Sketch a couple pages of simple cube forms and envision how each cube might open or move. (see pg 71).
