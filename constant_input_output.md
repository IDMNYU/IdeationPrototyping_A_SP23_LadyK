# Constant Input or Constant Output project

Choose either for the next 10 weeks of the semester. **Do not do both**:

*   Discovery Log (**considered as input**)
*   Creative Process Project: Individual (or Collaborative) Daily, Weekly, or Monthly (**considered as output**)

#### Discovery Log (Input, Learning, Absorbing)

*   Each week’s discovery log is due on Sundays before 2pm. However, I suggest that you don't wait until the last minute. I would suggest posting AS you discover.
*   Discovery logs can NOT be submitted after each due date. Logs are checked weekly. You cannot back date them to get them to count.
*   If you didn’t discover anything new, post literally that you did not discover anything new this week. This, admittedly, is a tough sell to me.

What’s new and different in your life in the following categories? Why does it appeal to you or not? Tell me about your post and why you are posting it here. What is this find and why is it significant? Posts must be thoughtful and of substance.

**Post on your process website on a daily or weekly basis.**

*   _Entertainment_ (Movies, Sports, Theater, Music, Museums, Zoos, Theme Parts, etc.)
*   _Media_ (Newspapers, Magazines, Books, TV, Radio, Internet, etc.)
*   _Food_ (Restaurants, Snacks, Home-Cooked Meals, Etc.)
*   _Hobbies_ (Skateboarding, Knitting, etc.)
*   _People_ (Friends, Strangers, Customers, Coworkers, etc.)
*   _Non-school Lectures, workshops, and documentaries._

#### Personal Creative Process Project: Individual (or Collaborative), Daily, Weekly or Monthly

*   Select a daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly schedule and create and promote a self- or team- directed project using social media and/or analog promotional materials.
    *   If weekly, at least 10 times
    *   If bi-weekly, at least 5 times
    *   If monthly, at least 3 times
*   Post or embed within your process website your chosen schedule with specific dates and share the link with your instructor.

**Also remember it does NOT have to be digital or visual.** It could be aural (i.e. music or soundscapes), culinary, etc. etc. times a gazillion possibilities. **The main requirement is that it is a creative project that YOU have a PERSONAL PASSION about. And you do it on a regular basis.**
