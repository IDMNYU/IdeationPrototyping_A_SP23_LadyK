### Critical aspects of this course, are diverse and multifareous forms of reasearch; as well as creative methods to communicate and present information. This assignment is a first pass at both of those aspects.


# Classmate Discovery

##### Research Part 1 (initial research + design of additional research mechanisms): Feb 6
##### Research (result of additional reseach mechanisms): Feb 13
##### Visual Map (including sketches): Feb 13

Using your classmate's care package, input map, constant input/output choices assignments and social media presences, supplemented with an interview, questionnaire, or survey, **create a visual map that represents a classmates’ background, training, discipline, and personal circumstances that led them to where they are today and where they are going.** Show cross-references (when you can). This visual map should be thoughtful, considerate and informed by your research.

This is a 2 part assignment.

The goals of this assignment:

* (1) To gather a wide variety of information, through various means (RESEARCH, COLLECT, ABSORB... see below for directives and ideas). See the Universal Methods of Research to broaden your research mechanisms. I'm looking for you to stretch and to develop your skills beyond their current limits.

* (2) To design a mechanism with which to present that information VISUALLY (BRAINSTORM, REMIX, DESIGN, VISUALIZE, SHAPE, FORM, CONNECT, BUILD). Remember to sketch ideas and concepts first in order to explore them.


Post this to your site. This includes research notes, questionaires, survey documents, images, sketches, brainstorms, etc. It's important to show all documents that tell the story of your process.

You pick the form or metaphor (NOT limited to): 
* a subway map, 
* a territory map, 
* a thematic network, 
* user journey map, 
* a table of contents of a book, 
* an index in the back of a book,
* a menu on a webpage, 
* a tree, 
* etc



##### Gathering Information/Research

* After revewing your interview partner (check their social media site, their process site's: input map, constant i/o interests, and their care package) AND reading the Terry Gross article, design a thoughtful questionaire based on this research.

* Design 1-2 other mechancisms to extract particular information. Possibilities include specific photo diary prompts (hardest part of their morning, most delightful part of day, most trusted friend, etc); going to their favorite places and studying those locations for 30 minutes noting observations and details; shadowing your partner through various locations of their day that you are not familiar with. See the Universal Methods of Research to broaden your research mechanisms.

* Set up a time to "meet" with your partner within the next 5 days, as well as scheduling in the other research activities.
