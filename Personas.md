# Persona


Personas are used often in User Experience Design to help designers focus on different types of users. Many times these personas are fictitious, yet plausible users. They help us to empathize with users and to truly to design with their needs in mind. By viewing these personas, we get into the mindset of users.

Develop 1 persona for each group. The persona for that group needs to be a symbolic member of that group. If your group is a minor, designated a spokesperson/conservatorship.


Each of these persona documents that you are creating should be separate from the previous. Each should be different in the following items listed below. These personas need to have a high-level of polish for a finished product (ie, final presentation is not in a sketch book, or lacking information). Consider the design of the document, so that the information is easy to visually digest. Do not over do the text! The design should be unified across the different personas. These need to be visually appealing documents as you will use them throughout your designs as reference points. 


Each should include the following information:

* Name of the persona
* Details about their role
* Needs and Goals
* Behavior, attitudes, opinions, motivations* Goals - both primary and secondary
* Challenges - both primary and secondary
* Primary Values
* Primary Fears
* Demographic Information
 - Age
 - Gender Identity
 - Education
 - Family
 - Location
* An image to represent the person (this can be a sketch, cartoon or photograph). Should represent age, life style and occupation
* Hobbies
* Noteable quotes
* What they read/Where they get their news + information
