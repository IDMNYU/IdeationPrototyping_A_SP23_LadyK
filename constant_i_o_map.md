# Constant Input/Output Exploratory Map

The goal of this assignment is to explore possibilities of for the [constant input/output project](constant_input_output.md). By the end of this assignment, you should be clear on whether you are doing an input project or an output project. You should also be clear on what type of project or subject you are exploring, as well as where to source your material.

Post the 2 maps (each with multiple depth levels) to your Process site under "constant input/output project". 

Create a 1 mind map exploring possibilities for a constant input project for the [Constant Input/Output project](constant_input_output.md). Place the word "inputs" in the center circle. Then branch out from there with possible topics. *Remember that if you choose the path of constant input, you are discovering or learning about something on a weekly basis (outside of a NYU course or your classes). This is material that you are absorbing or taking in.* Use this mind map to explore possible topics, subjects, mediums, etc. Branch out further with possible site, sources and locations of this information. 

Create a second mind map exploring possibilities for a constant output project for the [Constant Input/Output project](constant_input_output.md). Place the word "outputs" in the center circle. Then branch out from there with possible topics and activities. These are things that you would be creating or doing which generate an output.

Note: If you want to learn a medium in order to generate something, this would still be considered an output project (versus input) because the ultimate goal is to generate something. Include in your schedule your learning aspects as well as your making. Posts to your Process site need to document both aspects.

As a result, branch out of each possibility exploring each further. What would you create? Can it take different forms? Are there derivatives? What do you need to learn in order to generate this? Be specific. Also explore what resources you need to generate this output.

Take pictures of your maps, including close ups. Be ready to post these to your process site.
