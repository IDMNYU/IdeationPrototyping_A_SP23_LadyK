### Semester Week 6a | Week 1: Future Project - Launch

1. Read Speculative Everything (see Slack for the link) Chapter 1. This chapter will situate the project, giving it context, as you are developing a speculative future. Do not skip it. Write a brief reflection and post under reflections (if you have not done so).


2. Research 5+ sources with regards to your [ingredients](Future.md). The ingredients are elements in your world. You are to research them so as to develop _a deep vocabulary about how each one operates_ in your Future. Go to the library and look up various books and periodicals. At least half of the courses should be books or periodicals (not online links). I highly recommend newspapers and news sources that are mainstream, reputable, and not a tabloid. Examples: The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, New York Times, Los Angles Times, National Public Radio, BBC, The Guardian, etc.


Document them with a brief reflection on each of their value with regards to your project. You are to begin an annotated bibliography for this project. 

3. Generate at 1-2 Mind Maps, further exploring this research and how it fits in to your world. Let your mind run. These mind maps should be dense, deep and layered. They should not be cursory. 

4. Post the visuals to your blog along with a written reflection about what was generated and what is developing.
